**ESApet (January 2023)**

Developed ESApet SMS service giving users access to their own virtual emotional support animal. Interaction and conversation was set up through webhooks to Twilio API and Cohereâ€™s command-light model. Applied prompt engineering to ensure safe responses and enable content moderation. Winner of Most Creative Use of Twilio at CruzHacks 2023.

**Priorly Time Tracker (January 2022 - October 2022)**

Developed the Priorly Time Tracker web application to help employees track their digital workloads and productivity. Priorly is a tool that can help employees observe their digital time consisely. With clear and informative visuals and analytics of their tracked time, users can identify distractions and other obstacles/inefficiencies they encounter in their workflow.

**3D Modeled Multiplayer Virtual Reality Game for Teenagers with CLP (Spring 2021 - Summer 2022)**

Worked with [UCSC's ASSIST Lab](https://assist.soe.ucsc.edu/) to help develop a Virtual Reality game to help teenagers with Cleft Lip/Cleft Pallate (CLP) with social skills and confidence building. The game was built using Blender to create 3D models and UNITY as a game engine. Interviews were conducted with teengers and their guardians to gain understanding of the situations interviewees encountered and struggles they face in day to day life with their self confidence and social skills. Key situations were storyboarded, modeled, and modularized in the game as levels CLP patients and their psychologists could play together to work through difficult social situations.

**Automating Microfluidics Experiments (Spring 2021 - Winter 2022)**

Worked with the [Braingeneers lab](https://braingeneers.ucsc.edu/) at [UCSC's Genomics Institute](https://genomics.ucsc.edu/) to help automate Microfluidics lab experiments conducted in Genomics Organoid lab. Artificially grown organoids require frequent feeding of nutrients. An automated fluid dispensing system was necessary for effectively feeding these organoids enabling their proper growth and development. To automate this process, a Raspberry Pi was hooked up to Tecanvaro Smart Valves controlling the dispensing of nutrients to batches of organoids. The Raspberry Pi is programmed to automate control over the Tecanvaro Smart Valves. Containerization of the Pi's controls and architecture system was developed to run control of the Microfluidics devices remotely from any architecture.
